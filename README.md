# 🏄‍♂️ Sachin Bashetti

**`Evolving DevOps Enthusiast (networking roots, diving into AWS_Devops)`**

I’m a self-taught DevOps engineer with a strong networking foundation, actively building hands-on projects around **CI/CD automation, containerization, Kubernetes, and GitOps**.

I focus on understanding **how systems actually work end to end** — from code changes to running workloads — and documenting them clearly so they’re easy to explain, reuse, and improve.

## 🔧 Skills & Tools (Hands-On)

### 🧩 DevOps & Cloud

* CI/CD: **GitHub Actions**, Jenkins (basic)
* Containers: **Docker**, multi-arch image builds
* Orchestration: **Kubernetes** (Deployments, Services, NodePort)
* GitOps: **Argo CD fundamentals**, Git as source of truth
* Infrastructure as Code: **Terraform (AWS basics)**

### 🖥️ Systems & Networking

* Linux administration & troubleshooting
* Networking fundamentals (DNS, ports, services, SSH)
* Bash scripting & automation
* Process & service management (`systemctl`, cron)

---

## 🚀 What I’ve Built Recently

* **GitHub Actions CI pipeline**

  * Automated Docker image build & push
  * Versioned image tagging using GitHub run IDs
  * Auto-updated Kubernetes deployment manifests from CI

* **GitOps-based Kubernetes deployment**

  * Nginx app deployed using Git-managed manifests
  * Argo CD used for state reconciliation
  * Immutable image versioning for predictable deployments

Each project is intentionally **small, focused, and interview-explainable**.

## 📖 Currently Learning

* Deeper Kubernetes concepts (probes, rollouts, scaling)
* AWS core services for DevOps (EC2, IAM, EKS basics)
* Terraform best practices and state management
* Observability fundamentals (metrics & logs – upcoming)

---

## 🌱 How I Work

* Build first, then refine
* Prefer clarity over buzzwords
* Document decisions like I’d explain them in an interview
* Improve projects incrementally instead of chasing “perfect”

## 🎯 Current Goal

To transition into a **junior / associate DevOps role**, with strong fundamentals in CI/CD, containers, Kubernetes, and GitOps, and continue growing toward platform-level DevOps responsibilities.
